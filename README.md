-**Branch**: A copy of your project where you can make changes without affecting the main project
-**Clone**: Downloading a project from the internet (like GitHub) to work on it on your own computer
-**Commit**: Saving changes to your project and adding them to its history, so you can track what you’ve done
-**Fetch**: Getting updates from the online project, but not applying them to your work yet
-**GIT**: A tool that tracks changes in your project, making it easier to work with others
-**Github**: A website where you can store and share your projects using Git
-**Merge**: Combining changes from one copy of the project into another
-**Merge Conflict**: When two people make conflicting changes in the same part of a file, Git can’t merge them automatically, so you have to fix it
-**Push**: Uploading your changes to the online project so others can see them
-**Pull**: Downloading the latest changes from the online project and combining them with your work
-**Remote**: The version of your project that’s stored online
-**Repository**: The folder where your project and its change history are kept
